# Currency-Converter-WESBOS

For those of you who are new to Modules in ES6 or need a brush up, this is pretty neat exercise from WesBos's Javascript Course.

You won't need much to run it on your browser, just grab it and read through the files and comments.

money.js is the starting point of the APP.

Cheers! ðŸ˜‡
